### ⚡️ PRASADWARE // v0.0.2

Welcome to my lair.

This isn’t your average dev portfolio. This is a glorified terminal façade for a sleep-deprived full-stack dev who’s allergic to UI fluff and has an unhealthy obsession with debugging at 3 AM. Built to look like a hacker's dashboard from a dystopian anime — because why not?

#### 🧠 INIT:

Hi. I’m Prasad Ware.
I break code, fix it, ship it, regret it, and then build something weirder.
This page? Just me flexing my GitHub addiction and side projects no one asked for (but I still built anyway).

#### 🔨 WORK:

* 1325+ commits: Mostly legit, some might just be me fixing typos or deleting `console.log`.
* Consistency chart: Proof that I don’t touch grass.

#### 🔗 PROJECTS I’VE UNLEASHED:

* `SolScope`: Solana-powered chaos.
* `GradeAI`: Because grading manually is a sin.
* `TokenDapp`, `SolFaucet`, `LinkMetrics`, and others that may or may not work on first load.

#### ✍️ BLOGS:

"Coming soon..." (just like that feature you promised your client three sprints ago)

#### 🎨 Aesthetic:

* Feels like a dark hacker terminal.
* Version tag just because I can: `v0.0.2` — beta life forever.
